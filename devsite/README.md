# Derrick Nagy – Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio site. It's a minimalist, fast-loading page built to showcase a few front-end skills and test out TailwindCSS in a real-world layout. The content includes experience, projects, certifications, and links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

The site is intentionally simple—just HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind—served with Vite for modern bundling and dev speed.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** – modern build tool for frontend development
- **TailwindCSS** – utility-first CSS framework
- **PostCSS** + **Autoprefixer** – for CSS transformation and browser compatibility
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – no frameworks, just DOM + modules
- **HTML5** – semantic layout

---

## Getting Started


### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your browser should open at `http://localhost:5173/` by default.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## Deployment

This is a static site, so you can deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, S3 + CloudFront).

## Project Goals

- Practice front-end layout and styling using TailwindCSS
- Build a minimalist, responsive portfolio with fast performance
- Showcase career experience and selected projects
- Keep dependencies light and structure simple
